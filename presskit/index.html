    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>um I worked on the game for a couple of months full time and it was good but I burned out.</p>

    <p>Then I took a break from it for about a year.</p>

    <p>Then I started again, doing at least 1 change every day but not working on it all the time at the expense of everything else.</p>

    <p>After a year of 1-change-a-day I was accepted to Stugan, a wonderful games accelerator program where you work on your game in a cabin in the woods for 7 weeks.</p>

    <p>Now I'm back.</p>

    <h2 id="developer-bio">Developer Bio</h2>

    <p>Matthew Gatland is a game developer in Auckland, New Zealand. After four years working on software for hospitals, he quit his day job and started making games full time.</p>

    <p>Matthew has made a lot of small games for game jams and 48-hour competitions, but Caves is his first really large project. The game is expected to take a few years.</p>

    <p>When he's not working on games, Matthew teaches programming to young women through <a href="http://girlcode.co.nz/">Girl Code</a>, a business he co-owns with his sister. He's also a founding member of Auckland's <a href="http://popuparcade.co.nz/">Pop-Up Arcade</a>, a collective that exhibits locally made video games in custom, DIY arcade installations.</p>

    <h2 id="to-do">To Do:</h2>
    <p>Talk about how the game is influenced by 90s games and 80s cartoons. Retro, but not pixel art - more like Thunderbirds \ Voltron \ retro-futurism and cartoon morality.</p>

    <p>Congratulations for scrolling to the end.</p>
